This is Junyoung Kim's work. 

I created directories by dates so I could organize it. 'January 14th' is the final update version of the JSON validator.

I used my test cases and some of the existing test cases from web to check if my JSON validator is working successful. 

Recursion is the main point of this project to check whether the given JSON is valid or not.

You can run this JSON validator by sending the shell program as an argument in the  main.c
