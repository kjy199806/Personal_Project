   <p> Current I am doing a project about website. It will be released when I am done </p>
   
   <h3> Reason why I have only C & C++ projects </h3>
   <p> I am very interested working as a backend developer. However, our school teaches Java on 4th semester. So, I created all of my projects with the language that I learned from 1st semester to 3rd semeseter. As you can see my projects, I have developed my algorithm, problem solving skills by going through these projects.</p>
